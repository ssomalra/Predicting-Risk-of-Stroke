# Predicting-Risk-of-Stroke
INFO-B 473 Application Programming for Biomedical Data Analysis: Final Project

A stroke occurs when abnormality obstructs the regular flow of blood into the brain, or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. This prevents the brain from getting sufficient oxygen and nutrients from the blood, causing brain cells to die rapidly and consequently trigger a stroke. The effects of a stroke can cause long-term brain damage, disability, or even death (CDC, 2022). According to the World Health Organization, stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, causing approximately 11% of total deaths as of 2019. Considering 80% of strokes are preventable (World Health Organization, 2020), I want to predict the likelihood of a patient getting a stroke based on various risk factors.

For this data exploratory analysis study, a publicly available dataset, called “Stroke Prediction Dataset” was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).
